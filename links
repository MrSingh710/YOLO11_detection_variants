Check File Size
If the file is larger than 4GB, split it into smaller parts before transferring:
split -b 2G yourfile.tar.gz part_
Later, you can merge them on the phone:
cat part_* > yourfile.tar.gz



# Step 1: Transfer the packed environment file to the target computer
# (Assume the file is already transferred as <packed_environment>.tar.gz)

# Step 2: Extract the packed environment
tar -xzf <packed_environment>.tar.gz -C <target_directory>

# Replace <packed_environment>.tar.gz with your file name
# Replace <target_directory> with the path where you want to extract the environment

# Step 3: Navigate to the extracted directory
cd <target_directory>/<environment_name>

# Step 4: Fix paths using the conda-unpack script
./bin/conda-unpack

# Step 5: Activate the environment
# For Linux/macOS:
source bin/activate

# The environment is now ready to use!
